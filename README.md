# dependency-graph

Python script for auto-generating product dependency graphs using Mermaid.

## Usage

1. Export product Excel sheet to CSV (example: `clara.csv`)
2. Generate mermaid code
   ```
   python mermaid.py myfile.csv
   ```
3. Copy output and paste it in the [Mermaid Online Editor ](https://mermaid.live)

Note that there will be no connections to usage examples. This is not supported by the
simple data model in the Excel sheet. We'll add them manually later.
